<h2>Lab 5: Basic PHP Scripting</h2>
<p>Lab 5 is an introduction to basic scripting in PHP. It provides an introduction to user input with the calculation form, and has more detail in
variables with the others. It teaches how to get an idea of how to display the IP address of the user accessing the web page. It also provides information on the 
User Agent, which gives the information about the way the user is accessing the web page. The final part of the page are two ways of making temperature conversions.
The first one is a simple conversion with only a single loop used, and the other is a more complex one that includes a function.</p>
